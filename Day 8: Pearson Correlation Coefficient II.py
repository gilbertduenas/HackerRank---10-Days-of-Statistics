# Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient is the test statistics that measures the statistical relationship, or association, between two continuous variables.  
# It is known as the best method of measuring the association between variables of interest because it is based on the method of covariance.  
# It gives information about the magnitude of the association, or correlation, as well as the direction of the relationship.

# Pearson's correlation coefficient is the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations. 
# The form of the definition involves a "product moment", that is, 
# the mean (the first moment about the origin) of the product of the mean-adjusted random variables; hence the modifier product-moment in the name.
