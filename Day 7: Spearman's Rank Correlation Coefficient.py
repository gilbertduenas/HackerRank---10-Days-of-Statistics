# In statistics, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient or Spearman's œÅ, named after Charles Spearman and often denoted by the Greek letter rho,
# is a nonparametric measure of rank correlation (statistical dependence between the rankings of two variables). 
# It assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function.
