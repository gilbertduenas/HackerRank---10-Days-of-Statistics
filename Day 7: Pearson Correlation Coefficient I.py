# Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient is the test statistics that measures the statistical relationship, or association, between two continuous variables.  
# It is known as the best method of measuring the association between variables of interest because it is based on the method of covariance.  
# It gives information about the magnitude of the association, or correlation, as well as the direction of the relationship.
